# A Quick Overview of Animal Classification

This post will provide a quick overview of the changes made to the 00-is-it-a-bird notebook to expand the functionality to multiple animal classes.
Please refer to the assignment document for the full solution and discussion of this question.

## Expanding to Multiclass Classification
The searches variable had to changed to include 10 different types of animals. However, just putting animal names into the search term gave poor results so 'nature
photography' was added as a prefix. This worked well but the program got the classes from the search terms by default, which would not work now, we would get 'nature photography bird'
instead of 'bird'.

To fix this a variable with just the animal names was created, and an iterator variable called number was also neccessary. A new path for this task was created.
```
searches = 'nature photography dog', 'nature photography cat', 'nature photography bird', 'nature photography pig', 'nature photography whale','nature photography turtle','nature photography zebra','nature photography giraffe','nature photography tiger','nature photography hamster'
animals = 'dog', 'cat', 'bird', 'pig', 'whale','turtle','zebra','giraffe','tiger','hamster'
number = 0
path = Path('animal_classification')
```
The dest variable was changed to create folder names from the animal variable rather than the searches variable, it gets this information by referencing the animal 
list element using the number variable. number is iterated at each pass to change the animal name for the dest folder.

```
for o in searches:
    #dest = (path/o)
    dest = (path/animals[number])
    dest.mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)
    download_images(dest, urls=search_images(f'{o} photo'))
    sleep(10)  # Pause between searches to avoid over-loading server
    download_images(dest, urls=search_images(f'{o} sun photo'))
    sleep(10)
    download_images(dest, urls=search_images(f'{o} shade photo'))
    sleep(10)
    resize_images(path/animals[number], max_size=400, dest=path/animals[number])
    number = number + 1
```

The dataloader was updated to use the TrainTestSplitter set at 80/20, and the batch size shown increased to 20 to get a better view of the downloaded images for each class.

```
dls = DataBlock(
    blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock), 
    get_items=get_image_files, 
    splitter=TrainTestSplitter(test_size=0.2, random_state=42),
    #splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42),
    get_y=parent_label,
    item_tfms=[Resize(192, method='squish')]
).dataloaders(path)

dls.show_batch(max_n=20)
```

Training the vision learner required no changes. Predicting required that the probs variable now be referenced to the zeroth element. The is because probs now returns the probability
that the image is each animal.

```
print(f"Probability it's a bird: {probs[0]:.4f}")
```
