# Getting Started

The subject of this post is the first Fastai lecture video covering the 'Is it a bird?' problem. Although I am not familiar with the comic series he references I do understand that it suggests that image classification was
nearly impossible less than 10 years ago. This seems an odd phenomena; surely the shallow methods used in the first half of this course could be applied to the problem with reasonable success? 

It does not escape me that the fact that this problem can be solved in 5 minutes with free toolsis largely due to the development of the Fastai library. Pytorch seems very verbose by comparison and would take a much longer time 
implement on its own. Python itself is a very high level language so to build Fastai ontop of Pytorch and keep the functionality of the base layer really shows the power of what Python is capable of.

Perhaps what I was most suprised about was the simplicity of webscraping, it has always been (atleast in my mind) a daunting task. When I first went through this notebook a few days ago it was working, but today it has an "index
out of range" error. I have made a brief post on Ed about this, seems like a few notebooks are not runnning today. Maintaining a codespace where all these examples run reliably seems like a big task, it was confusing enough getting
it to work as a student. 

This is the error:

I know a few students are having this issue so hopefully the teachinh team can sort it soon.UPDATE: Turns out deleting your codespace environemnt and opening a new one solves this issue.

The process of setting up the datastructures for the classifier seems fairly streamlined. For each class of image a for loop is iterated through that saves 200 of each image, and resizes them. After that the images just need to be checked for corruption. That is all the pre-processing needed it seems.

The datablock function provides an easy way to setup a dataloaders object. It can get data, label it, resize it, and then split into training and testing sets in a single line of code. Presumably it also has the functionality to handle multiple classes of images which will be useful for the second assignment question.

The last step is to train a prebuilt image classification model. Resnet18 is a common image classifier that gives good performance, and the built in hyperparameter tuner called fine_tune() is used to fine tune the pretrained model.

To try out our new learner simply call the predict method on the learner and insert the image as an arguement, the (correct) answer comes out very fast with the confidence rating.

Hopefully this notebook is easily adaptable to multiclass problems, but that is for another day.

Bye
